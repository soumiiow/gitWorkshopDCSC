Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks.  She  went for a walk in the forest.  Pretty soon, she came upon a house.  She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.

At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge.  Goldilocks was hungry.  She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.

"This tastes AMAZING!" She shouted with glee.
Goldilocks snatched up the bowl of porridge. 
She scurried out of the house, and ran into the woods, never to be seen again.
